# Lorenz Attractor

A structure which looks like a butterfly in one plane and an owl mask in another.

## About the Lorenz

The Lorenz attractor is an attractor that arises in a simplified system of equations describing the two-dimensional flow of fluid.
In the early 1960s, Lorenz accidentally discovered the chaotic behavior of this system when he found that, for a simplified system, periodic solutions of a form grew for Rayleigh numbers larger than the critical value. Furthermore, vastly different results were obtained for very small changes in the initial values, representing one of the earliest discoveries of the so-called butterfly effect.

## Install
